# Task 05 - Descriptive Statistics & Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository documents how well large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can reason about small public sports datasets, with a focus on the 2024 SU Womenâ€™s Lacrosse data.

## Summary

The goal is to challenge an LLM to answer both basic and complex natural language questions by giving it structured data as context. This explores the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in handling descriptive statistics and inferential reasoning.

Prompt templates
Python scripts for data cleaning and stats generation

## Approach

- Used Python scripts for initial descriptive statistics.
- Prompt engineered questions for ChatGPT with varied difficulty.
- Recorded both successes and LLM failures.
- Where LLM answers were incorrect, validated with manual computation and Python outputs.
